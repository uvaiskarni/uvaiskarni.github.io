I am a firm believer in the ability of technology to benefit humanity. I'm delighted to contribute to the success of my team and the growth of my firm as someone with a master's degree in computer science. A self-motivated learner with experience in machine learning and computer vision, who is keen to contribute to cutting-edge technical advancement. A patron of research (published 5 research papers and applied for 1 patent).

Ever since my secondary school Programming has been part of life, I was one of the few kids who would get excited when we had Computer Lab. My passion only grew as I engaged with building bots utilizing Arduino and Raspberry Pi, thought of coding that permits me to prompt small machines with rudimentary intelligence captivated me. That is the coinciding year when tesla released model S with Autopilot which opened me to the concept of Artificial Intelligence.
