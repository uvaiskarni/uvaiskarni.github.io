In this contemporary world, the number of accidents occurring has increased drastically which leads to an increase in the number of fatal deaths. This is mostly caused by the distractions that driver encounters. For example, texting and driving,less attention span of driver,etc. Due to the above reasons, autonomous cars would be a better option which takes the errors of a driver away from the equation. The proposed concept in the paper is to make an autonomous downscaled model car using a generic RC car as base. We aim to achieve the above by using image processing which is trained by using neural networks to create a model through which autonomous cars
are achieved. The hardware components used in this project are Ras pberry PI 3 B microcomputer , camera module, HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor. We achieve the following
features in our model, (a)Lane detection, (b)Traffic signal identification, (c)Road signs identification, (d)Obstacle detection avoidance and (e)Pedestrian Detection.

This Project was presented at IEEE SS12 2018 prelims event held at Jeppiar Institute of Technology, Chennai.
​
The work includes  design of an RC toy car, that can drive autonomously on a given map in which it has been trained rigorously. It involves training the car on the map while capturing photos of the environment and co-relating them to generate a neural network model using machine learning. The RC car has driven autonomously on the given map successfully. Obstacle avoidance has been implemented using ultrasonic sensor and the RC car successfully stops when it faces an obstacle. Haar-cascade image processing has been used successfully to identify stop signs and red traffic signal, so as to make the car stop.
